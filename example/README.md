# App Example

This app is currently used for [integration and e2e testing](https://github.com/jtart/uni/tree/master/cypress/integration) of `uni`, so it has been setup to use the local code in `../`.  An `npm install` will still local `uni` deps and create a local `uni` build that is used. _(NB: this is likely only temprorary until a clearer distinction between integration app and shoecase app(s) is made.)_

The app implements an SPA and uses `styled-components` and graphQL w/ `apollo`. It uses [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/) to get off the ground quickly.

## Usage

Run `npm run dev`. This bundles server and client JS and starts a server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

The app has 3 routes:
- `/` - a basic page with some links to the below routes
- `/styledComponents` - a page that includes styled components (just a header)
- `/apollo` - a page that uses GraphQL

The styles/graphQL data are server-side rendered if requests are made directly to those routes. If the routes are clicked through to on the client-side application, the styles/data is client-side rendered.

### Wrappers
Wrappers are optional HOCs that enable the plugin of libraries to your application. See [wrappers](https://github.com/jtart/uni/tree/master/example/src/wrappers) for an indication on how styled-components and Apollo are implemented:
- [client-side wrapper](https://github.com/jtart/uni/blob/master/example/src/withClientWrapper.jsx) - used for Apollo
- [server-side wrapper](https://github.com/jtart/uni/blob/master/example/src/withWrapper.js) - used for styled-components/Apollo

See [here](https://github.com/jtart/uni/blob/master/README.md#wrappers) for more information on wrappers.
